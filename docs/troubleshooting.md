# Troubleshooting

The panel renders the latest usage record written by each collector. It does not invent limits or hide a collector failure, so the message shown in a provider tab is the useful place to start.

## Colors or logos look wrong

The panel follows Omarchy's live foreground, surfaces, tracks, fonts, and
critical color. Provider marks choose their light/default SVG from the bar's
current foreground, including hover states. Warn is intentionally fixed amber
(`#F2B705`) and does not change with the theme; Critical uses Omarchy's urgent
color. Restart the shell after a QML change because plugin components are
cached.

## I see an auth or endpoint card

The coloured card shows the provider status in its heading and the collector's next step below it. It is intentionally not a generic plugin error.

- **Claude:** live session/weekly limits need a signed-in `claude` CLI. Sign in again, or check `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when using a non-default Claude configuration. Local transcript-derived token statistics can still appear without live limits.
- **Codex:** limits require the Codex app-server RPC. Confirm Codex itself can reach the app-server and that its local configuration (`CODEX_HOME`, when set) is the one you expect. Local session statistics can remain available while the endpoint is down.
- **Fireworks:** check `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID`, then the fallback credentials in `~/.fireworks/auth.ini` or OpenCode's auth file. The exact collector help text identifies which credential was not detected.

For another provider, follow the card's collector-supplied help text. A collector should use the `auth-missing` and `endpoint-down` conventions in [collector-contract.md](collector-contract.md), so its panel state names both the problem and how to resolve it.

## A provider is missing

Check the three deliberately different visibility states:

- `enabled: false` hides the provider everywhere and excludes it from refresh.
- `enabled: true` with `showInBar: false` hides only its bar meter; it remains selectable in the panel.
- `Bar slot: Off` hides a provider, `Fixed` keeps it visible, and `Cycle`
  puts it in the rotating pool. `barCycleSlots` controls how many rotating
  meters are visible at once. Choosing Fixed or Cycle enables that provider.

The bar lays out the configured providers up to the bundled collector safety
ceiling; any future overflow is collapsed into a `+N` indicator. Click it to
open the complete provider switcher. A provider with no usage record yet is
also absent until the next collector refresh produces usable data.

If every known provider is disabled or hidden from the bar, the module glyph remains so Settings are still reachable. A completely new machine with no discovered usage record has no widget at all; that is the intentional empty state.

## Fireworks has no balance

Fireworks can report token usage without a prepaid balance. The live balance endpoint may be unavailable to API keys; in that case an estimate needs a `fundedAmount` in `~/.config/omarchy/agents/fireworks.json`:

```json
{
  "accountId": "",
  "fundedAmount": 20,
  "fundedAt": "2026-07-01"
}
```

Without that amount, the balance section is intentionally omitted rather than pretending the account is empty.

## Cost estimate is absent or differs from a bill

`Estimated API cost` appears only when the collector supplies a `cost` block. It is a token-derived estimate at the collector's published API price list, not an invoice, subscription charge, tax calculation, or account balance. Check the selected provider and record timestamp before comparing it with a vendor bill; cached reads, non-token charges, or a changed price list can differ.

## The panel looks unchanged after editing QML

Quickshell caches compiled plugin components by URL. A plugin rescan does not reload a changed QML file. Run:

```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

This is Omarchy's supervised shell restart. For a local branch preview, fetch/check out that branch in the live plugin checkout first, then restart.

## A custom collector does not render

Run the record through the validator before debugging the panel:

```bash
./scripts/agent-usage-doctor /path/to/provider.json
```

or pipe JSON to its standard input. The record contract documents required fields, error conventions, and the size/data limits the display enforces.
